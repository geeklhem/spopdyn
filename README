spopdyn : Stochastic Simulation of Meta-population dynamics

This is the implementation of a simple model to study the impact of
environmental changes on niche structured communities. It is currently
actively developped and __do not__ have a stable interface or API
yet. (It should be better by January 2014).

It consists in a modification and a python wrapping of the excellent
[pSSAlib](http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q%3Ddownloads/stochastic_chemical_net)
(partial-propensity stochastic simulation algorithms library)
developped by the MOSAIC group (MPU-CBG, Dresden) to efficiently
simulate chemical reaction-diffusion networks [Ramaswamy 2009, 2010
and 2011].
